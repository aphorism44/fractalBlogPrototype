I'm working on a "fractal" blog, whereby the entries are structured and read in a fractal pattern. This was the prototype, written in Java using an MVC layout.

The current version of this engine on my webpage is very similar to this prototype, but needs to be updated for user-friendliness.

The idea of the fractal text structure comes from mathematician Rudy Rucker in his 1987 book "Mind Tools," although he has subsequently revisited, revised and refined his ideas.
